# CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship
## Task 3 – Secure Coding Review

This project contains a professional secure coding review of a Python login system. The review identifies vulnerabilities in the original code and provides a secure implementation with recommended best practices.

### Contents
- `login_system.py` – Original code (vulnerable)
- `secure_login_system.py` – Fixed, secure version using SHA-256 password hashing
- `CodeAlpha_Task3_Secure_Coding_Review_Report.pdf` – Professional report detailing vulnerabilities, fixes, and best practices

### Objective
To audit an application’s code, identify security flaws, and implement secure coding practices to prevent risks such as:
- Hardcoded passwords
- Plain-text password storage
- Lack of input validation

### How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Run the secure code:
```bash
python secure_login_system.py
